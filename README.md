# Quantum-Efficiency-Calculator-for-Electrochemiluminescence
This repository takes in pulsing or CV data, emission spectrum, hardware quantum efficiency and relevant background scans to find the quantum efficiency of the ECL emission.
The code and math is detailed extensively in a publication in Analytical Chemistry, named 'Absolute Electrochemiluminescence Efficiency Quantification Strategy Exemplified with Ru(bpy)32+ in the Annihilation Pathway' in 2021. https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c02403

Many parameters are needed for the successful determination of the quantum efficiency and reading the above text is necessary to use this software efficiently.

After installing this app, it performs all the math for you after loading in your data. Example data files are supplied to test the program and pictures are provided below:
